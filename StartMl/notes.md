# Start Ml 

A Input is a feature or varbale 

# What is a feature
A feature describles the value of a input 

the input data can come in as two types of feactures 

- quantitative: This is the best for ml beacuse data that is quantitative they are numbers 
- qualitative : This is ususaly labels or symbols that are words 

With a qualitative dataset you need to covert them into numbers 
so the ml algorithm can understand it so one of the easiest ways of doing that is with one-hot encoding this turns all features into binary values like a 1 or 0 ex:

# human readable
|temp|hot|cold|
-----|----|----|
|hot|yes|no|
|cold|no|yes|

# Computer readable or Binary 
|temp|hot|cold|
-----|----|----|
|hot|1|0|
|cold|0|1|




# What is a matrix

a matrix is a collection of numbers that are arraged in rows and columms like a table 

    
        |1.1|1|
    X = |0.0|0|
        |1.1|1|
